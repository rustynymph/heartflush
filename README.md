# Heart rate activated toilet flusher
Electronics and software created by Annie Kelly ([personal website](http://rustynymph.com) / [academic website](http://anniekelly.me)) in collaboration with performance artist [Michelle Ellsworth](http://www.michelleellsworth.com/).

This project encourages people to collaborate to flush a toilet using their heart rates. When the 3 pulse sensors detect heart rates that average within a certain threshold, the servo pulls up on the toilet chain therefore flushing the toilet.

### Hardware  
============
* Arduino Uno  
* 1 [Servo (Generic High Torque)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11965)
* 3 [Pulse Sensors](https://pulsesensor.com/)

### Software  
Uses the Arduino [Servo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/servo) and [PulseSensorPlayground](https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensorPlayground) libraries.

##### Files
* [heartflush.ino](./heartflush.ino) is the main Arduino project file for the pulse sensing and toilet flushing  
* [flushtest_onstart.ino](./flushtest_onstart.ino) is for testing the flushing only, it will flush the toilet when the Arduino is powered on
